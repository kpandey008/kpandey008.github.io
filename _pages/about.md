Hi, I am currently a second year PhD student in Computer Science at the [University of California, Irvine](https://www.uci.edu/) advised by [Prof. Stephan Mandt](http://www.stephanmandt.com/). I recently completed a summer internship supervised by [Dr. Maja Rudolph](http://maja-rita-rudolph.com/) at Bosch AI Research. My current research work is supported by the [HPI Fellowship](https://hpi.ics.uci.edu/).

Previously, I was a graduate student in Computer Science at the [Indian Institute of Technology, Kanpur](https://www.iitk.ac.in/) advised by [Prof. Piyush Rai](https://www.cse.iitk.ac.in/users/piyush/) where I also collaborated with [Dr. Abhishek Kumar](http://www.abhishek.umiacs.io/) and [Prof. Hamim Zafar](https://hamimzafar.wixsite.com/home).

My current research interests broadly lie in the study of Deep Generative Models and Unsupervised Representation Learning. I am currently primarily interested in the theory and applications of Score-Based (or Diffusion) Models and related families (like Flow Matching, Interpolants etc). Feel free to contact me about any collaboration opportunities or queries about my work in general.
