<!-- Write your biography here. Tell the world about yourself. Link to your favorite [subreddit](http://reddit.com). You can put a picture in, too. The code is already in, just name your picture `prof_pic.jpg` and put it in the `img/` folder.

Put your address / P.O. box / other info right below your picture. You can also disable any these elements by editing `profile` property of the YAML header of your `_pages/about.md`. Edit `_bibliography/papers.bib` and Jekyll will render your [publications page](/al-folio/publications/) automatically.

Link to your social media connections, too. This theme is set up to use [Font Awesome icons](http://fortawesome.github.io/Font-Awesome/) and [Academicons](https://jpswalsh.github.io/academicons/), like the ones below. Add your Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, Google Scholar, or just disable all of them. -->

Hi, I am currently a second year PhD student in Computer Science at the [University of California, Irvine](https://www.uci.edu/) advised by [Prof. Stephan Mandt](http://www.stephanmandt.com/). I recently completed a summer internship supervised by [Maja Rudolph](http://maja-rita-rudolph.com/) at Bosch AI Research. My current research work is supported by the [HPI Fellowship](https://hpi.ics.uci.edu/).

Previously, I was a graduate student in Computer Science at the [Indian Institute of Technology, Kanpur](https://www.iitk.ac.in/) advised by [Prof. Piyush Rai](https://www.cse.iitk.ac.in/users/piyush/) where I also collaborated with [Dr. Abhishek Kumar](http://www.abhishek.umiacs.io/) and [Prof. Hamim Zafar](https://hamimzafar.wixsite.com/home).

My current research interests broadly lie in the study of Deep Generative Models and Unsupervised Representation Learning. I am currently primarily interested in the theory and applications of Score-Based (or Diffusion) Models. Feel free to contact me about any collaboration opportunities or queries about my work in general.
