<!-- Write your biography here. Tell the world about yourself. Link to your favorite [subreddit](http://reddit.com). You can put a picture in, too. The code is already in, just name your picture `prof_pic.jpg` and put it in the `img/` folder.

Put your address / P.O. box / other info right below your picture. You can also disable any these elements by editing `profile` property of the YAML header of your `_pages/about.md`. Edit `_bibliography/papers.bib` and Jekyll will render your [publications page](/al-folio/publications/) automatically.

Link to your social media connections, too. This theme is set up to use [Font Awesome icons](http://fortawesome.github.io/Font-Awesome/) and [Academicons](https://jpswalsh.github.io/academicons/), like the ones below. Add your Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, Google Scholar, or just disable all of them. -->

Hi, I am currently a first year PhD student in Computer Science at the [University of California, Irvine](https://www.uci.edu/) advised by [Prof. Stephan Mandt](http://www.stephanmandt.com/). Previously, I was a graduate student in Computer Science at the [Indian Institute of Technology, Kanpur](https://www.iitk.ac.in/) advised by [Prof. Piyush Rai](https://www.cse.iitk.ac.in/users/piyush/). I also closely collaborate with [Dr. Abhishek Kumar](http://www.abhishek.umiacs.io/) and [Prof. Hamim Zafar](https://hamimzafar.wixsite.com/home).

My current research interests braodly lie in the study of Scalable Bayesian inference and Unsupervised deep representation learning with applications in Generative Modeling. However, I am also interested in drawing ideas from the fields of computational cognitive science and Computational neuroscience to make current AI systems more robust.

While I am not involved in reading about any of these things, I like to think and discuss about the impact of training large models on our climate and where are we progressing as a community on our quest towards AGI and beyond (whatever that might be!). I am also a proponent of the slow science manifesto. Read about it [here](http://slow-science.org/). Feel free to contact me about any collaboration opportunities or queries in general.
