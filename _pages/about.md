Hi, I am currently a third year PhD student in Computer Science at the [University of California, Irvine](https://www.uci.edu/) advised by [Stephan Mandt](http://www.stephanmandt.com/). My research is currently supported by the [Chan-Zuckerberg Initiative](https://chanzuckerberg.com/).

I recently completed a summer internship at the [GenAIR](https://research.nvidia.com/labs/genair/) group at NVIDIA where I worked with [Arash Vahdat](http://latentspace.cc/) and [Morteza Mardani](https://research.nvidia.com/labs/genair/author/morteza-mardani/). Previously, I was a graduate student in Computer Science at the [Indian Institute of Technology, Kanpur](https://www.iitk.ac.in/) advised by [Piyush Rai](https://www.cse.iitk.ac.in/users/piyush/) where I also collaborated with [Abhishek Kumar](https://abhishek.ml/) and [Hamim Zafar](https://hamimzafar.wixsite.com/home).

My current research interests broadly lie in the study of Deep Generative Models. I am primarily interested in the theory and applications of iterative refinement models (diffusion/interpolants/flow matching models) and their applications for diverse practical and scientific applications.
