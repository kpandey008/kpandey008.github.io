  abstract  = {Diffusion Probabilistic models have been shown to generate state-of-the-art results on several competitive image synthesis benchmarks but lack a low-dimensional, interpretable latent space, and are slow at generation. On the other hand, Variational Autoencoders (VAEs) typically have access to a low-dimensional latent space but exhibit poor sample quality. Despite recent advances, VAEs usually require high-dimensional hierarchies of the latent codes to generate high-quality samples. We present DiffuseVAE, a novel generative framework that integrates VAE within a diffusion model framework, and leverage this to design a novel conditional parameterization for diffusion models. We show that the resulting model can improve upon the unconditional diffusion model in terms of sampling efficiency while also equipping diffusion models with the low-dimensional VAE inferred latent code. Furthermore, we show that the proposed model can generate high-resolution samples and exhibits synthesis quality comparable to state-of-the-art models on standard benchmarks. Lastly, we show that the proposed method can be used for controllable image synthesis and also exhibits out-of-the-box capabilities for downstream tasks like image super-resolution and denoising.

  abstract     = {Despite recent advances in inferring cellular dynamics using single-cell RNA-seq data, existing trajectory inference (TI) methods face difficulty in accurately reconstructing cell-state manifold and inferring trajectory and cell fate plasticity for complex topologies. We present MARGARET, a novel TI method that utilizes a deep unsupervised metric learning-based approach for inferring the cellular embeddings and employs a novel measure of connectivity between cell clusters and a graph-partitioning approach to reconstruct complex trajectory topologies. MARGARET utilizes the inferred trajectory for determining terminal states and inferring cell-fate plasticity using a scalable absorbing Markov Chain model. On a diverse simulated benchmark, MARGARET out-performed state-of-the-art methods in recovering global topology and cell pseudotime ordering. When applied to experimental datasets from hematopoiesis, embryogenesis, and colon differentiation, MARGARET reconstructed major lineages and associated gene expression trends, better characterized key branching events and transitional cell types, and identified novel cell types, and branching events that were previously uncharacterized.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.},
